#### Installation
If you still using laravel 4.1 use the **1.3.0** version

To get the latest version of dyaa/pushover simply require it in your `composer.json` file.

```js
"dyaa/pushover": "dev-master"
```

After that, you'll need to run `composer update` to download the latest Version and updating the autoloader.

Or

```bash
composer require dyaa/pushover:dev-master
```



Once dyaa/pushover is installed, you need to register the Service Provider. To do that open `app/config/app.php` and add the following to the `providers` key.

```php
'Dyaa\Pushover\PushoverServiceProvider',
```

Next you add this facade to `app/config/app.php`

```php
'Dyaa\Pushover\Facades\Pushover',
```

To use this in your L5 application:

```php
use Dyaa\Pushover\Facades\Pushover;
```
